# Toxic-Comment-Multilabel-Classification
This project develops a machine learning model for multilabel classification of toxic comments, using NLP techniques like TF-IDF. The model detects various types of toxicity (e.g., hate speech, harassment) and is deployed using Flask for real-time analysis. It leverages Random Forest for optimal classification and content moderation.
